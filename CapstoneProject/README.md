## Capstone Project - Sparkify

Sparkify is a online music company (fake use case) that has is facing some user churning and they want to have a model that can predict and somehow explain them why users are churning. These companies make good money either with free and paid accounts so all users matter in this industry and having a good model can help them on many points like:

- Understand if there is something wrong with the service that can help the teams to fix.
- Help them to proactivly act and make offers to clients that are about to churn to try to retain them as much as possible. 

### Project Motivation
In this project I aim to focus on the user experience and try to understand if the experience of the users are playing an important role on the churning rate. So, based on the data that we have available I will focus on 3 main aspects:

- Sessions and duration
- Errors / Adverts
- Songs played

### Structure
- **Sparkify.ipynb**: Code with the entire analysis.
- **Sparkify.html**: HTML of the notebook.
- **mini_sparkify_event_data.json**: Sample of the data used to the study.

### Libraries
- Python3
- pandas
- spark
- spark-mllib
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pedrogandola.blogspot.com/2021/04/churn-prediction-for-sparkify.html).

## Project 1 - Blog Post

### Project Motivation
Project developed to allow us try to understand what features can be added to Boston Airbnb units in order to increase the unit prices, more specifically

- What amenities could owners add/improve on their units to allow them to increase the prices within their pricing groups? **(AmenitiesAnalysis.ipynb)**
- What is the relation between the different pricing groups and the number of reviews and reviews scores? **(ReviewsAnalysis.ipynb)**
- Can we have a regression model that allows us to predit the unit price for Boston? **(PriceModel.ipynb)**

### Structure
- **AmenitiesAnalysis.ipynb**: Code used to do the Amenities/Price analysis.
- **PriceModel.ipynb**: Code used to do the Price Linear Regression Model.
- **ReviewsAnalysis.ipynb**: Code used to do the Reviews/PricingGroup analysis.
- **common.py**: File contaning some common functions.
- **data/boston/listings.csv**: Copy of the Boston listings data provided by [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
